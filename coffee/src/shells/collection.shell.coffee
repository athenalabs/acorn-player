# CollectionShell -- one shell to contain them all.
#
# The idea behind CollectionShell is that it provides a generic group for
# other shells. It provides the basic, core functionality necessary
# to construct one unified shell out of other "subshells".
#
# Types of media groups made possible by CollectionShell are, for example:
# * Playlists
# * Galleries
# * Slideshows
# * Spliced Video
#
# CollectionShell does its magic by a simple abstraction, it interacts with
# acorn as one single shell, and then directs actions/events to the specific
# subshells that should get them.
#
# CollectionShell is represented by a list (array) of subshells.
# For example:
#
# {
#   "shellid": "acorn.CollectionShell",
#   "shells": [
#     {
#       "link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQSNhk5ICTI",
#       "shell": "acorn.YouTubeShell",
#     },
#     {
#       "link": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX0D4oZwCsA",
#       "shell": "acorn.YouTubeShell"
#     }
#   ]
# }
#
# Note that the order of the shells in the array is significant, as
# CollectionShell uses this order to present the subshells.
