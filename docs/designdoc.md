way.

## Overview

Note: overview from a product-centric view.

### Terminology:

* **media**: a viewable, consumable stream of information, usually of a
  particular kind

  (e.g. video, sound, text, games).

* **media primitive**: cannonical kinds of media

  (e.g. video, text, sound).

* **multimedia**: a kind of media that encompasses other kinds of media

  (e.g. games, slideshow).


* **media kind**: a concretely defined type of media (on the web).

  (e.g. text, an audio file, an image file, a YouTube Video, a Vimeo Video)

* **media piece**: an independent, atomic media item

  (e.g. a specific video).

* **remix**: a media piece built on top of other media pieces.

  (e.g. a specific video clip from a specific video).

* **player**: web technology that enables viewing/consuming of media pieces.

* **native-player**: web technology of a particular vendor, to be used to play
  media pieces hosted by the vendor

  (e.g. YouTube Embedded Player, Vimeo Player).

* **acorn**: a remix combining media pieces through the use of computation.

* **``acorn-player``**: a player that plays acorns


* **shell**: an ``acorn-player`` module to play and edit specific media kinds.

  (e.g. ``ImageLinkShell``, ``YouTubeShell``).



### Description

``acorn-player`` is a web technology that enables playing and remixing
different kinds of media in a unified way.

``acorn-player`` enables:
* playing media pieces of various kinds
* composing remixes
* embedding in webpages

#### playing media pieces

``acorn-player`` aims to be a player that can play all kinds of different media
pieces, of various kinds and from various vendors. For example, it should be
able to:

* show videos, music, images, text, documents, etc.
* more specifically, show YouTube Videos, Vimeo Videos, image files, sound
  files, Flash games, PDF files, etc.
* and show compositions of these, such as playlists, galleries, slideshows,
  spliced videos, etc.

Thus, ``acorn-player`` should have a very general approach to interacting with
 media that can be extended to support each specific kind of media.

The current design of the player viewing state features a content viewing area,
and a generic controls bar:

##### Content Area

The content area is left up to specific shells to render as they wish, for
example:

* VimeoShell

![vimeo-shell](http://static.enrage.me/athena/test.vimeo.shell.png)
  Renders vimeo player through an embedded iframe.

* PDFShell

![pdf-shell](http://static.enrage.me/athena/test.pdf.shell.png)
  Renders pdf through an embedded iframe.

* LinkShell

![link-shell](http://static.enrage.me/athena/test.link.shell.png)
  Renders website through an embedded iframe.

##### Controls Bar

The controls bar is further divided in two sections:

#### Code Hierarchy

##### acorn.js
[acorn.js](/athenalabs/acorn-player/blob/master/js/src/acorn.js) defines and implements the base acorn model and top level API. First, the acorn model includes basic operations common to all acorns including (but not limited to) ways to construct acorns from URLs to media or preexisting acorn data objects. Second, it provides useful accessors to the acorn data to fields like the acornid. Third, it provides utility methods for the JSON serialization and deserialization of acorns. Fourth, it includes preliminary support for integration of acorn with a backend of your choice.

Outside of the acorn data model, [acorn.js](/athenalabs/acorn-player/blob/master/js/src/acorn.js) includes a slew of utility functions (under acorn.util.*) that facilitate programatic interaction with acorns.
