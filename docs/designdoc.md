player that supports viewing all sorts of different media types, in a unified
way.

## Overview

Note: overview from a product-centric view.

### Terminology:

* **media**: a viewable, consumable stream of information, usually of a
  particular kind

  (e.g. video, sound, text, games).

* **media primitive**: cannonical kinds of media

  (e.g. video, text, sound).

* **multimedia**: a kind of media that encompasses other kinds of media

  (e.g. games, slideshow).


* **media kind**: a concretely defined type of media (on the web).

  (e.g. text, an audio file, an image file, a YouTube Video, a Vimeo Video)

* **media piece**: an independent, atomic media item

  (e.g. a specific video).

* **remix**: a media piece built on top of other media pieces.

  (e.g. a specific video clip from a specific video).

* **player**: web technology that enables viewing/consuming of media pieces.

* **native-player**: web technology of a particular vendor, to be used to play
  media pieces hosted by the vendor

  (e.g. YouTube Embedded Player, Vimeo Player).

* **acorn**: a remix combining media pieces through the use of computation.

* **``acorn-player``**: a player that plays acorns


* **shell**: an ``acorn-player`` module to play and edit specific media kinds.

  (e.g. ``ImageLinkShell``, ``YouTubeShell``).



### Description

``acorn-player`` is a web technology that enables playing and remixing
different kinds of media in a unified way.

``acorn-player`` enables:
* playing media pieces of various kinds
* composing remixes
* embedding in webpages

#### playing media pieces

``acorn-player`` aims to be a player that can play all kinds of different media
pieces, of various kinds and from various vendors. For example, it should be
able to:

* show videos, music, images, text, documents, etc.
* more specifically, show YouTube Videos, Vimeo Videos, image files, sound
  files, Flash games, PDF files, etc.
* and show compositions of these, such as playlists, galleries, slideshows,
  spliced videos, etc.

Thus, ``acorn-player`` should have a very general approach to interacting with
 media that can be extended to support each specific kind of media.

The current design of the player viewing state features a content viewing area,
and a generic controls bar:

##### Content Area

The content area is left up to specific shells to render as they wish, for
example:

* VimeoShell - Renders vimeo player through an embedded iframe.

* PDFShell - Renders pdf through an embedded iframe.

* LinkShell - Renders website through an embedded iframe.

##### Controls Bar

The controls bar is further divided in two sections:

* **acorn-wide section**: controls that affect or leverage all acorns,
regardless of the underlying media kinds (or the shells used to render them).

* **shell-specific section**: controls that affect or leverage the media
playing, and thus depend on the underlying media kinds and the shells used to
render them.

The controls above are:

* acorn-wide controls:
  * **Edit** opens an editor to edit the underlying acorn.
  * **Link** opens the current acorn webpage (if it is saved to a server).
  * **Fullscreen** fullscreens the acorn in the browser.


* shell-specific controls, in this case for a MultiShell:
  * **Previous** switches to the previous subshell.
  * **List** opens a list of all subshells in this MultiShell.
  * **Next** switches to the next subshell.
