# Writing Shells

So, you've checked out ``acorn``, and you want to create a new shell to remix
amazing new kinds of media! This is the place to go.


You may want to familiarize yourself with how Backbone Views work.


## ImageLinkShell

Here is an annotated (with ``//@@``) version of ``ImageLinkShell``, a shell
that renders image files linked on the web.


```javascript

// ImageLinkShell --  A shell that links to images and embeds them.
// ----------------------------------------------------------------


//@@ ImageLinkShell definition.
//@@ It derives from LinkShell, the generic shell for link-based media.

//@@ calling .extend is the Backbone view inheritance pattern.
var ImageLinkShell = acorn.shells.ImageLinkShell = LinkShell.extend({

  //@@ shellid specifies the shell type, which will be recorded into the
  //@@ 'shell.shell' value in acorn data.
  shellid: 'acorn.ImageLinkShell',

  //@@ the type here indicates the primitive (or canonical) media kind.
  //@@ this is used to indicate (with icons) to users what to expect.

  // The canonical type of this media. One of `acorn.types`.
  type: 'image',

  //@@ validRegexes specify regular expressions for links to match this shell.
  //@@ here, image files are defined to end in an image file extension.
  //@@ of course, some images won't have URLs like that, but certain kinds
  //@@ of media do follow this pattern closely (see YouTubeShell).

  // **validRegexes** list of valid LinkRegexes for images
  // .jpg, .png, .gif, etc.
  validRegexes: [
    UrlRegExp('.*\.(jpg|jpeg|gif|png|svg)'),
  ],

});


// Shell.ContentView -- renders the image within the bounds of the player.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------

//@@ ImageLinkShell.ContentView definition.
//@@ The ContentView is what determines how this shell will render.
//@@
//@@ It derives from LinkShell.ContentView, the LinkShell specific ContentView.
//@@ It is usually the case that shells that derive from others have ShellViews
//@@ that derive from their parent's ShellViews (like here!).

ImageLinkShell.ContentView =  LinkShell.ContentView.extend({

  //@@ this particular shell uses a template.
  template: _.template('\
    <div class="wrapper"></div>\
  '),

  //@@ the render function, like in any other Backbone View.
  render: function() {

    //@@ retrieve the link. shell.link is a function in LinkShell.
    var link = this.shell.link();

    //@@ create an img html element, and assign the link.
    var img = $('<img>').attr('src', link);

    //@@ render the template.
    this.$el.html(this.template);

    //@@ append the img tag to the rendered template, in the right spot.
    this.$el.find('.wrapper').append(img);

  },

});


//@@ This Shell does not need to specify an EditView. It simply uses its
//@@ parent's, LinkShell.EditView. It provides exactly the functionality
//@@ we want.

//@@ Registering the shell is important. It's what allows the acorn-player
//@@ to construct the right Shell objects for the right shell identifiers.

// Register the shell with the acorn object.
acorn.registerShell(ImageLinkShell);

//@@ That's it! It was that easy to create an acorn view.

```

## MultiShell

[MultiShell](../js/src/shells/multi.shell.js) illustrates the power of
abstracting with shells. Take a look at its source.

## YouTubeShell and VimeoShell

[YouTubeShell](../js/src/shells/youtube.shell.js) and
[VimeoShell](../js/src/shells/vimeo.shell.js) illustrate how to embed and
interact with other vendor players.
